# PentriX
This game was made for the Project 1 - Part 2, from the Bachelor in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering and Maastricht University.  
The code is written in collaboration with the group I was in: Lucas Giovanni Uberti-Bona Marin, Silvia Fallone, Antonio Rodriguez, Sarah Waseem, Pierre Bongrand and myself.

In short, this is like a normal Tetris game, but the pieces are not made of 4 blocks but 5, called pentominoes (https://goo.gl/images/WSRRWj). Moreover, it has an AI included (inspired in: https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/), which uses heuristics to make decisions during the game.

It can be played using the following controls:  
 - RIGHT ARROW: move 1 unit to the right  
 - LEFT ARROW: move 1 unit to the left  
 - DOWN ARROW: move 1 unit down  
 - UP ARROW: rotate (clockwise)
 - SPACE: drop
 - Q: quit
 - B: toggle bot (active / inactive)

General settings such as the weights for the Bot's heuristics, the size of the window, the number of rows and columns of the board, etc. can be modified in PInfo.java
